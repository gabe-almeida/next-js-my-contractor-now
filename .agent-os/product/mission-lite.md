# Product Mission (Lite)

MyContractorNow is a lead generation and distribution platform that helps homeowners find contractors while enabling lead buyers to acquire high-quality, compliance-verified leads through an automated auction system.

The platform serves contractor networks and lead buyers who need granular control over lead acquisition with ZIP code-level targeting and automatic compliance verification. Unlike traditional lead platforms, MyContractorNow provides a parallel auction system with built-in TrustedForm and Jornaya tracking, ensuring every lead has verifiable compliance documentation before delivery.
