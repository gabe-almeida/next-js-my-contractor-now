# This Command Has Been Removed

**`/create-spec` is redundant and has been removed.**

## Why?

`/new-spec` now does EVERYTHING in one command:
- Initialize folder
- Analyze codebase
- Ask informed questions
- Deep targeted analysis
- Write spec.md with stories + standards
- Create tasks.md with file paths

## What to Use Instead

**Use `/new-spec "Feature name"` for all spec creation.**

If you need to regenerate a spec, just run `/new-spec` again in the same project - it will create a new dated folder.

**This file will be deleted in the next deployment.**
